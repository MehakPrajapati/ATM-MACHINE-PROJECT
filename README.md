# ATM-MACHINE-PROJECT [Link](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html)
This is a simple ATM Machine simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project allows users to create a PIN, log in using the PIN, and perform basic ATM operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and exiting the system.
The application is designed using modern UI styling with a purple gradient background and star effects, and the logic is implemented using JavaScript OOPS concepts.
This project was created for learning and practicing front-end development and basic programming logic.
